Overview
This repository offers a ready-to-use client-side starter for Vercel Blob. It pairs Next.js 15 with React 19 to deliver a smooth, responsive experience. The project uses TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind CSS v4 for design, and shadcn/ui for a polished component library. It aims to be 100% SDK compliant, ensuring predictable behavior when interacting with blob storage APIs. The architecture emphasizes a clear flow from user actions to SDK calls, with a strong focus on developer experience, maintainability, and extensibility.

Why this starter

Usage and workflows
- Drag and drop uploads
  - Drop files onto the designated drop zone to kick off an upload.
  - The UI displays a progress indicator for each file.
  - You can pause, resume, or cancel uploads as needed.
- Progress tracking
  - Real-time progress bars reflect the bytes uploaded vs total size.
  - Global progress shows an overall upload status across all files in the queue.
- Multipart uploads
  - Large files are split into chunks and uploaded sequentially or in parallel according to configuration.
  - Retry logic handles transient network failures gracefully.
- File gallery
  - The gallery provides previews for images and thumbnails for other file types.
  - Users can expand to view details, rename using inline editing, or apply actions on multiple selections.
- Copy and delete operations
  - Copy operations allow duplicating files within the blob storage or within the appâ€™s gallery.
  - Delete operations remove files from the gallery and from the storage backend with a confirmation step.
- Advanced configuration
  - You can customize chunk size, retry policies, concurrency levels, and UI behaviors.
  - The configuration also covers authentication flow, caching policies, and SDK client options.
- SDK compliance
  - The app adheres to the Vercel Blob SDK surface guidelines, ensuring predictable behavior across environments.
  - Type-safe wrappers reduce boilerplate and drift between SDK versions.

How it works
- The client-side module interfaces with the Vercel Blob SDK through a thin layer that abstracts common operations:
  - Initialize client with authentication and endpoint configuration
  - Upload files via a drag-and-drop interface or programmatic calls
  - Track progress using events or observable streams
  - Manage a local gallery with metadata and live previews
  - Support multipart uploads for large files with resumable capabilities
- The UI layer uses Tailwind CSS v4 for styling and shadcn/ui components for consistency and accessibility
- TypeScript types provide strong guarantees for API usage and data structures
- The architecture emphasizes modularity so you can swap in your own blob storage backend if needed

SDK compliance and best practices
- The codebase adheres to the Vercel Blob SDK surface where possible
- Strong typing and explicit error handling reduce runtime surprises
- Clear separation between UI, data models, and storage interactions
- Safe defaults with opt-in advanced features to minimize risk
- Observability hooks for monitoring and debugging
- Accessible by design: keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and clear focus management

Demos and usage examples
- Basic example: single-file upload
- Multiple files: queue and progress
- Large files: multipart upload with retry and pause
- Gallery interactions: preview, rename, and delete
- Copying assets within blob storage
- Cleanup and housekeeping: removing orphaned uploads

Sample code snippets
- Initialize SDK client (TypeScript)
  - import { createBlobClient } from "../sdk/blobClient";
  - const client = createBlobClient({ endpoint: "<endpoint>", credentials: "<token>" });
- Upload a file with progress
  - const result = await client.uploadFile(file, {
      chunkSize: 1048576, // 1 MB
      onProgress: (p) => console.log(`Uploaded ${p.loaded}/${p.total} bytes`),
    });
- Start a multipart upload
  - await client.multipartUpload(file, { partSize: 5242880, maxConcurrentParts: 4 });
- Retrieve gallery items
  - const items = await client.listFiles({ limit: 50, sort: "createdAt" });

Accessibility and inclusive design
- All interactive elements support keyboard focus and navigation
- Clear labels and defined roles for components
- Color contrast meets accessible standards
- Announcements for dynamic changes via ARIA live regions
- Consistent visual cues for state changes (loading, success, error)

Performance considerations
- Debounced updates to prevent UI thrashing
- Lazy loading of gallery items and thumbnails
- Efficient image preview generation when possible
- Caching of frequently accessed metadata to reduce API calls
- Efficient error handling with user-friendly messages

Testing and quality
- Unit tests for core utility functions
- Integration tests for the upload workflow
- Mocking for SDK calls to enable fast, isolated tests
- Linting and type checks enforced in CI
- Pre-commit hooks for formatting and basic checks

Troubleshooting
- Common issues with access to blob storage
- Network failures during multipart uploads
- Misconfigured endpoints or credentials
- Debug tips for inspecting upload progress and errors
- How to read and interpret logs and error messages

Roadmap
- Enhance cross-browser compatibility for file handling
- Add more export options for gallery items
- Expand multipart configuration with dynamic tuning
- Improve testing coverage for edge cases
- Support additional storage backends beyond Vercel Blob

FAQ (frequently asked questions)
- What is Vercel Blob and how does this starter help?
  - Vercel Blob is a storage solution. This starter provides a client-side integration that works with the SDK. It focuses on a smooth UX for uploading, listing, and managing blobs.
- Do I need to run server-side code?
  - This starter focuses on the client side. Some deployments may require server-side support for authentication or proxying; adapt as needed.
- Can I replace UI components?
  - Yes. The architecture is designed to allow you to swap components while keeping core functionality intact.
- Is this ready for production?
  - It is designed for production-grade usage, with careful handling of errors, retries, and performance considerations. Adapt configurations to your environment.

Design notes
- The UI emphasizes clarity over novelty. Components are built for accessibility and consistency.
- The code adheres to modern TypeScript practices, with explicit types and clear interfaces.
- The styling uses Tailwind CSS v4 for rapid iteration and theming.
- shadcn/ui complements the component library with polished, accessible primitives.

Security considerations
- Avoid exposing sensitive credentials on the client side. Use proper authentication and least-privilege access.
- Validate file types and sizes on the client, and enforce server-side checks where appropriate.
- Ensure CORS policies and API endpoints are configured correctly to prevent data leakage.
- Keep dependencies up to date to minimize security vulnerabilities.

Notes on usage with real projects
- When integrating into an existing project, align the configuration with the projectâ€™s authentication scheme.
- If you customize the storage endpoint, ensure the SDK wrappers are updated accordingly.
- For large teams, consider adding a dedicated environment for storage operations and a separate deployment pipeline for storage-related changes.

Final remarks
- This starter provides a solid, well-structured base for client-side blob storage workflows. It combines a modern UI with robust storage interactions, focusing on reliability, performance, and developer experience.
